# MT4R

MT4R is a robotics reference book I authored with the goal of making mathematical derivations in various foundational areas of robotics more accessible. It systematically organizes over 90 key algorithms, including detailed mathematical derivations, summaries of key concepts, and corresponding Python code implementations. The book also covers definitions and analytical methods for more than 60 common technical problems. Currently, about 80% of the content is complete, and the book is still being updated. Your feedback, suggestions, and corrections are highly welcome!

MT4R 是我独立撰写的一本机器人技术工具书，致力于降低机器人学各基础领域中数学推导的学习门槛。书中系统梳理了90余种重要算法，涵盖详尽的数学推导过程、算法核心总结，以及配套的Python代码实现；同时归纳了60多种常见技术问题的定义与分析方法。目前全书已完成约80%，仍在持续更新中。诚挚欢迎您对书中内容提出勘误、建议或意见！
